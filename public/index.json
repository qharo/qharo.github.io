It trains a 10 million parameter U-Net on 96,000 32x32 images. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models # DDPMs are generative machine learning architectures designed to learn and replicate the underlying probability distribution of a dataset, enabling the creation of new, similar data samples.\nThe training setup forms a Markov chain and operates in two distinct phases: The forward diffusion process systematically introduces Gaussian noise to the original data across a large number of timesteps (T), following a predetermined schedule. This gradually transforms the meaningful data into pure noise, analogous to how a drop of ink would slowly diffuse through water until completely distributed.\nThe reverse diffusion process is where the actual generation occurs. The model, trained to identify and remove noise at each step, begins with pure noise and iteratively denoises it across timesteps T through 0. At each step, it predicts and removes the noise component, gradually reconstructing a coherent sample that matches the learned data distribution.\nThe math behind how these models work is fascinating, very clearly explained by Calvin Luo and Explaining AI.\nDataset and Training # The dataset I used is from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I trained the model on an RTX A4000 for 40 epochs. I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented the cosine scheduler from Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nResults # ","date":"1 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/ddpm/ddpm/","section":"Projects","summary":"A PyTorch implementation of DDPM trained to generate Devanagiri Script.","title":"Devanagiri-DDPM","type":"Project"},{"content":"Detailed project description goes here.\n","date":"1 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/experience/inria/","section":"Experience","summary":"Detailed project description goes here.","title":"INRIA","type":"Experience"},{"content":" Projects Devanagiri-DDPM 1 January 2023\u0026middot;2 mins A PyTorch implementation of DDPM trained to generate Devanagiri Script.
